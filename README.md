## The Application

**Cookery** is a recipe management and meal planning application, designed to be a tool for the everyday cook. The application design uses an MVC architecture with the Spring Boot framework to focus on modularity and scalability. Spring Security manages user authentication, requiring users to register and log in to access the application. Upon logging in the users has full access to all functionality but only their personal ingredients and recipes. 

The process of this project focused on scrum methodology, completing the project in sprints. The task for each of these sprints, derived from user requirements, were chosen based on their level of dependency, importance, and risk. The core functionalities were completed in the beginning sprints. The biggest challenge, or risks, in this project was the level of developer knowledge. This led to revisions in the recipe costs processes as well as an incomplete user password reset functionality.
