# Why Cookery?

  Living in a military community, I have had the priveledge of being apart of the full meal experience with adults in various phases of life. Through this time I have learned that planning, shopping, and cooking can look very different for each person. But I noticed that there were a few consistent problems everyone shared. 
- Difficulties finding specific recipes as they navigate through various pictures and social media accounts
- Brain fog while meal planning
- Difficulties meal planning on a budget

  While applications exist with tools for these problems, they are still loaded with excesss information and a finanical costs without a trial. Cookery aims to lessen the technological burden while maximizing its existing features. We want it to feel like your personal cookbook, true to your lifestyle and needs.

  The recipe generator aims to support meal planning by randomly pulling from the users own ingredients. To meet the users changing needs and cravings, the user can input criteria to filter the generated recipes. This also allows users to input ingredients they have on hand and the application will generate recipes that include those ingredients.



# The Future  

 Cookery was designed to focus on modularity and scalability. The evolution of cookery will focus around user feedback. While maintaining simplicity, the following features should be considered to be included in future application improvements;

- User ability to e-mail existing recipes (or another feature to physically save recipes)
- User ability to share and pull from community recipes
- Enhanced filter functionalities for recipes and ingredients
